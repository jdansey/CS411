We chose the MEAN Stack to develop our application because we believe that it is one of the faster platforms to learn offers the most support. The MEAN stack is composed of a Mongo database, Express for the web application framework, Angular.js for the front end, and Node.js for the backend. The MEAN stack uses only JavaScript, which is one of the most popular programming languages used by developers. Node.js is also an efficient back end architecture. 

An alternate architecture would be the LAMP stack, which requires learning PHP, SQL, and JavaScript to do the same applications we could implement with just JavaScript in the MEAN stack. In addition to learning 2 extra languages, the LAMP stack requires mySQL, which is a relational database. Relational databases often get bogged down in very long and complicated queries. We believe that a Mongo database with mongoose is simpler and more efficient.
